        <h3>What do we mean by Personal Information?</h3>
        <p>In this Policy, “personal information” means information or an information set that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of GenieCapture to identify an individual. Except as described in this Policy, GenieCapture will not give, sell, rent

        <p>Personal information does not include “Usage Data” which we define as encoded or anonymized information or aggregated data we collect about a group or category of services, features or users which does not contain personally identifying information.
            Usage Data helps us understand trends in usage of the Service so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor the Service. In addition to collecting and using Usage Data ourselves, we may share Usage Data with third parties,
            including our customers, partners and service providers, for various purposes, including to help us better understand our customers’ needs and improve the Service as well as for advertising and marketing purposes. We do not share Usage Data
            with third parties in a way that would enable them to identify you personally.</p>
        <h3>How Do We Collect, Use and Share Your Personal Information and Other Information?</h3>
        <h4>Information You Provide to Us</h4>
        <p>When you register for the Service, we ask for personal information such as your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, as well as certain related information like your company name and website name. If you sign-up for a 30-day free trial
            account, you are not required to enter your credit card information unless and until you decide to continue with a paid subscription to the Service. GenieCapture uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary

        <p>GenieCapture may use the personal information you provide to operate the Service and tailor it to your needs, for billing, identification and authentication, to contact and communicate with you about the Service and your use of the Service, send
            you marketing materials (subject to your opt-out option), for research purposes, and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service.</p>
        <p>GenieCapture may also share your personal information with its third-party service providers (such as its credit card processors and hosting partners) to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other services we use

            system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.Occasionally, we may connect personal information to information gathered in our log files, as necessary to improve the Service for individual customers. Otherwise, we generally use this information
            as we would any Usage Data, to analyze trends,administer and maintain the Service, or track usage of various features within the Service.</p>
        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p>A “cookie” is a small software file stored temporarily or placed on your computer’s hard drive. The main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web server to identify your computer and web browser, and tailor web pages and/or login information to your
            preferences. Cookies help us promptly display the information you need to use the capabilities of the Service and other information which we consider to be of interest to you. By gathering and remembering information about your website preferences
            through cookies, we can provide a better web and marketing experience. Cookies don’t give us access to users’ computers, and the information we collect through cookies doesn’t include personal information.</p>
        <p>When you use the Service we utilize “session cookies,” which allow us to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to process your online transactions. Session cookies disappear from your computer when you close your web browser
            or turn off your computer. We also utilize “persistent cookies” to identify you as a GenieCapture customer or end user and make it easier for you to log into and use the Service. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your
            web browser or turn off your computer.</p>
        <p>Essential: Essential cookies are those that are critical to the functionality of the Service. We use these cookies to keep a user logged into the Service and remember relevant information when the user returns to the Service.</p>
        <p>Functional: We use functional cookies to track users’ activities in the Service, understand their preferences and improve their user experience. These cookies can also be used to remember configurations of the Service that you can customize.</p>
        <p>We utilize various categories of cookies, which are summarized below along with the options available to you to manage them.</p>
        <p>Marketing: We engage third party providers to serve a variety of marketing cookies that enable us track and analyze usage, navigational and other statistical information from visitors to the GenieCapture Websites. This information does not include
            personal information though we may reassociate this information with personal information we have collected when it is received. Marketing cookies are also used to track the performance of our advertisements and are employed by third party
            advertising networks that we utilize. These ad networks follow online activities of visitors to the GenieCapture Websites and use this information to inform, optimize and serve tailored advertisements on the GenieCapture Websites or on other
            websites you visit that we believe would most effectively promote the Service to you. We also use third parties to collect information that assists us in other methods of “remarketing” our Service to visitors to the GenieCapture Websites,
            including customized email communications.</p>
        <p>You can generally accept or decline the use of cookies through a functionality built into your web browser. If you want to learn more about cookies, or how to control or delete them, please visit http://www.aboutcookies.org for detailed guidance.
            Please note that if you do elect to disable your web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you may not be able to access or take advantage of many features of the Service.</p>
        <p>Many jurisdictions require or recommend that website operators inform users as to the nature of cookies they utilize and, in certain circumstances, obtain the consent of their users to the placement of certain cookies. If you are a customer of
            GenieCapture, it is your responsibility to inform the individuals with whom you interact using the Service as to the types of cookies utilized in the Service and, as necessary, to obtain their consent. If you require more specific information

        <h4>Web Beacons</h4>
        <p>We also employ web beacons to help us better manage content in the Service by informing us what content is effective. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements
            of internet users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on websites. We tie the information gathered by web beacons to personal information we otherwise collect, and use them
            in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns as well as to operate and improve the Service. You can opt-out of these emails by following
            the unsubscribe instructions within such marketing emails.</p>
        <h4>Other Information Sharing</h4>
        <p>In addition to the purposes described above, we disclose personal information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also share such information
            if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service,
            or as otherwise required by law.</p>
        <h4>Protection of Information</h4>
        <p>GenieCapture is committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. We utilize robust precautions to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information within the Service, by employing technological, physical and
            administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and carefully-developed security procedures. For example, when you enter sensitive information (such as login credentials and all your activity on our Services) we encrypt the transmission
            of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). These technologies, procedures and other measures are used in an effort to ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you authorized to access
            your data. However, no internet, e-mail or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take care in deciding what information you send to us in this way.</p>
        <h4>Links to Other Websites</h4>
        <p>The Service contains links to other websites and web applications that are not owned or controlled by GenieCapture. Please be aware that we do not determine and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other sites. We
            encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service, and read the privacy statements of other websites and web applications linked to the Service. This Policy applies only to information collected by the Service.</p>
